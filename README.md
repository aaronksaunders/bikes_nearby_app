Welcome to Bike Finder: forked from adampash/bikes_nearby_app

####Remember you will need to setup you Android Map to get this working

See information here on the Appcelerator website

####Debugger Code was added to force a specific location for testing.

When this function is called, it will default to this location. I added this because I was testing 
from Washington DC and it is too far to get any data to show

```
// FOR DEBUGGING
locate_bikes.setDebugLocation([40.70122128, -74.01234218]);
```
